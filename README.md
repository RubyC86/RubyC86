- 👋 Hi, I’m @RubyC86
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Planning - Experienced PSM, designing - Learning Management Systems, Database and Agile based Dev Team management apps, and Client based automations, learning - Ruby, JS, and Python.
- 🌱 I’m currently planning ... and creating my own pages and content with CSS and HTM on ATOM so that I can have the upgrades either collabed or freelanced and linked to my Youtube, Anchor, Shopify, Label, and itunes pages
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... HTML CSS and will consider learn to upgrade my pages using JS - I just do not want to learn the language without a focused purpose.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Linkedin, Twitter, Git, GitHub, Idk, I'm really not much of a coder.
